Hi, I'm Dan Avner.

I was adopted by an amazing woman, Lillian Avner, along with my biological half-sister, Thea Avner. I grew up never doubting how much I was loved.

On October 17th, 2017, I was woken early in the morning by a phone call—my mother had passed in her sleep. On February 3rd, 2022, I received another early morning call—this time, my sister had passed in her sleep.

The purpose of this site is to spend the month of October sharing and reflecting on my experiences with grief. I hope to inspire others to feel comfortable sharing their own journeys as well.

I'm not an expert on grief—just a guy who loved deeply and lost deeply, and who has spent a lot of time working through the pain.

Enjoy.
