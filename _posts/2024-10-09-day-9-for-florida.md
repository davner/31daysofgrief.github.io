Florida has always been a place of resilience. Even in the face of tragedy, people look out for each other. Neighbors help neighbors, and the community comes together, as it always has.

Now, living out of state, I’m getting updates from friends and family as this hurricane bears down on Florida. It’s hard being far away, knowing the destruction and loss happening back home.

To my friends and family in Florida: I’m thinking of you constantly. Though I’m not there, my heart is with you.
