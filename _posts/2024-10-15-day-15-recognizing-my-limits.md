Pouring my heart into *31DaysofGrief* has been a journey unlike any other.

It’s been a while since I’ve felt so passionate about a project. Each post takes hours of revision, reflection, and revisiting my grief. The messages, calls, and conversations that have come out of it, both with old friends and new, are moments I will treasure. I’ve learned from all of you, rekindled friendships, found closure, and deepened bonds. In a way, I’ve built a community. ***We built a community.***

What I’ve come to understand over the years is that we are never alone in our grief. Though our pain is unique, loss is inevitable for all of us. But that shared experience doesn’t have to be isolating. If this project has taught me anything, it’s that grief connects us all, even in the moments we feel most disconnected from the world. Talking about it, sharing it, has a way of lessening the loneliness that grief can create.

That said, I’ve realized I need to step back&mdash;just for a moment. Between work deadlines, preparing for an event, travel, our anniversary, and my mom’s anniversary, I’ve been stretched thin. I need to pause, to catch my breath, to make space for the heavy emotions this project brings up. I’m recognizing my limit. It’s okay to take breaks. It’s okay to not always be strong. And it’s okay to admit when you need a moment to gather yourself. This doesn’t mean I’m giving up on *31DaysofGrief*&mdash;far from it. But I need to allow myself to recharge, so I can come back fully present.

I’ll resume this journey on Día de los Muertos. Until then, I hope each of you take this time to reflect on your own journey, just as I will on mine. If you’ve been carrying your grief in silence, maybe use this time to open up, even if it’s just to yourself.

**And if you ever need someone to listen, I’m here, whenever you need me.**
