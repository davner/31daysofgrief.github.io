I think about time a lot. Especially since moving to Los Angeles, where distances aren’t measured in miles, but in minutes. Time governs everything.

It governs everything in my work, too. As a software engineer in time-domain astronomy, I have to be ahead, ready to respond to short-lived events and trigger our telescopes. Time zones are always on my mind, as the telescopes I support are in Chile, Arizona, and Hawaii. Daylight savings can kiss my piss.

I bring up time because of the outpouring of love and support I received after my first post. The messages from friends and family—some I haven’t spoken to in years—reminded me of how much time  it’s been since I last checked in with many of them. For some, their last memory of me is frozen in time, at my lowest moments: the celebration of life for my sister, or my mom. A snapshot of me, stuck.

For many of them, that’s the version they remember. But a lot has happened since then. For many, I never told them of the work I’ve put into healing and processing. I am not just surviving, I am thriving. #31DaysOfGrief isn’t a cry for help—it’s a reflection. I truly appreciate the love, but I want you to know I’m doing well. I hope this doesn’t come off as ungrateful.

Grief can disrupt time. It causes time dilation. making time feel relative and passing differently for each person. Sometimes it slows down, making the world blur by, or speeds up, pushing you from one moment to the next.

Grief gave me the unhealthy habit of measuring time by how many more times I’ll get to see someone. Most of my family and friends don’t live in California, so I only see them once or twice a year. For a while, I’d find myself calculating how many more times I might see them in my lifetime. It put so much pressure on those moments that I struggled to enjoy them. Grief made me hyperaware of the time remaining. To break this habit, I’ve started focusing on quality over quantity. I had to accept that I can’t be everywhere all at once. Instead of thinking about “how many more visits” I have left, I focus on “this visit” and being fully present during this visit. This shift has made each encounter more meaningful. It allowed me to truly appreciate the time I have with the people I love. However, as loved ones get older, it’s getting difficult to not focus on “how many more visits”.

But grief, strangely enough, has also taught me how to slow down time and take control. Just the other day, I had one of those moments I wanted to hold on to, one of those moments where time feels like it’s speeding up because everything is so perfect. My little family and I were having a cozy night at home. Milly, our pup, was darting back and forth on the couch, chasing her toy while I play-fought with her. Alexis watched us, smiling, as she decorated for Halloween. The Halloween Baking Championship played in the background. Penny, our cat, was curled up in the cozy reading chair.

Suddenly, I felt this wave of awareness wash over me. I realized this was a moment I wanted to remember. I grounded myself—feeling the rug under my feet, the squeaky sound of Milly’s toy, and taking a deep breath in. For that moment, I slowed down time. I took a mental snapshot. I thought about how much I love this moment, this feeling. For that brief time, the past, present, and future collapsed into “now,” and I felt like I had all the time in the world to appreciate that feeling.

**I get to set the reference point.**
