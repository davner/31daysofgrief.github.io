October is a celebration of the dead. And with death everywhere this month, it’s a little easier to talk about.

For the next month, I’m taking on a personal project: the ***31 Days of Grief***. I’ll be sharing how grief changed me, how it reshaped my family, the power of therapy, and finding joy in what remains. Posts might range from detailed traumatic stories, reminiscing on important memories, to “this movie made me cry” moments (Coco, obviously), or even a dead parent/sibling joke or two.

This isn’t about seeking sympathy or "I'm sorry" comments. **Please, no pity**. It’s about opening up a conversation and sharing stories with each other because grief is heavy, but we don’t have to carry it alone. If you want to contribute, please comment. I would love to have you join me on this journey.

By the end of this month, I hope we gain new perspectives on grief, or at least discover some emo songs to cry to. I also hope you’ll come to know my mom and sister--not just through my grief, but through the love and life we shared. Their stories, their light, deserve to live on.

*And maybe, by sharing them with you, their memory will find a place in your heart too.*
