Before she died, my sister gave me a letter.

It said:

> **Dear Daniel,**
>
> Holy crap! I haven’t written for a while, but I just wanted to let you know how important, special, and appreciated you are.
>
> Even though I said things and done things that altered our relationship and trust, I wanted to tell you thank you for still believing in me even when we might disagree on certain things. We’re still family. We fight, have disagreements, we won’t see eye to eye, but that’s okay because we all have different opinions. That’s what makes us unique.
>
> After mom passed, I’m not going to lie because there is no point, I didn’t know how to grieve or process what had happened, so I turned to food. I didn’t take care of myself properly&mdash;I basically just gave up.
>
> Some days are hard, but thankfully I have a great therapist, a new group of friends, and an understanding fiancé who makes sure I have everything I need.
>
> I just wish I had listened to mom before because maybe then things wouldn’t be how they are now. But that’s what makes us grow and persevere. We learn from our mistakes and move on.
>
> I wish mom would have told us how sick she was, but I know she didn’t because she didn’t want to worry us. Honestly, in a weird way, mom’s passing brought us closer and made me realize how precious life is and how we shouldn’t take anything for granted.
>
> Well, I love you and hope everyone is doing well. Hopefully, we can get together soon!
>
>**Love you! Miss you!**
>
>**Be Safe!**
>

She had meant to mail this to me a few weeks before.

I haven’t written back yet. I’ve come so far, but I still freeze at the thought of responding. Tears stream down my face just thinking about it.

I hope by the end of this project, I’ll be strong enough to finally write her back.
