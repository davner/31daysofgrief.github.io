Not long after my mom passed, I had my best friends over one night in late October. We built a fort in the living room—chairs, cushions, and a giant blanket draped over us, with mattresses underneath. It was one of those forts that make you feel like a kid again.

We watched *Halloweentown*, a movie I used to watch every Halloween with my mom and sister. It’s a tradition I still keep. That night, with my friends around me, we laughed, made terrible jokes, and Alexis killed an impression of the Cromwell witches chanting to save *Halloweentown*. **Aggie Cromwell would have been proud.**

For a little while, the grief lifted, and I felt surrounded by love.

A few days after my sister passed, my family, friends, and I were at a Krispy Kreme in Decatur, Alabama—Thea’s town. I spotted a silly, signature-release, heart-shaped donut adorned with a bee, iced to say "BEE MINE" and immediately thought, *"Thea would think this donut is so stupid and hilarious."* But in that moment, it felt like Thea and I both agreed in unison that it was the best thing ever&mdash;to propose to Alexis with that **stupid-ass bee donut**. I got down on one knee, holding this special donut, as iconic as Hagrid’s *"HAPPEE BIRTHDAE HARRY"* cake, and asked,

*"Will you bee my valentine?"*

Alexis rolled her eyes so hard that I thought they’d get stuck. But she smiled, too.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: .85rem;"><em>She said, "Ok". Don't judge my outfit, my sister just died.</em></p>

It was ridiculous, but it was also a moment of lightness in the middle of all the heaviness. I think that moment showed her I wasn’t lost.

Both of those moments, inside the fort and in that Krispy Kreme, became core memories. They didn’t take away the pain, but they reminded me that **I was still here**, still capable of laughter and love.

For me, grief didn’t demand that I give up those things&mdash;it just meant I had to make space for the sorrow alongside them. My loved ones showed me that.
