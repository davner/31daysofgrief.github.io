I was inspired by yesterday’s post to talk about the solar eclipse of 2024. My last shared memory with my mom was during the eclipse of 2017. We made a promise to see the next one together.

Fast forward to 2024. Alexis and I were talking with Dolores (*my favorite mother-in-law*) about how the path of totality goes through Mazatlán, Mexico. Turns out, Dolores’ mom, Lilia, was from Escuinapa, a small town about an hour and a half away.

We had family there. We’d see the childhood home, meet extended family, and learn about Alexis grandmother’s early life. **Before we knew it, the eclipse became a family reunion.** Two pilgrimages&mdash;one to see Alexis’ family history with Dolores, Alexis, and Lilia, and the other to keep my promise to my mom.

It was easy to fall in love with Mazatlán. The city had fully embraced the eclipse. Sun and moon artwork everywhere, parades celebrating the event, concerts, banda music, beautiful beaches. The best ceviche and coconut shrimp I’ve ever had. But most of all, seeing Lilia’s life and learning about the family I’m honored to be a part of.

Then the day of the eclipse arrived.

As the four of us found a spot to watch, I felt it. The weight of seven years. My chest tightened, and a sense of anticipation fell over me. This was the moment. I handed out the solar glasses, and it all came flooding back. I had been here before&mdash;helping my mom get ready for the eclipse.

The banda wrapped up their last song, and the countdown to totality began. Each second ticked by, heavier than the last. I could feel time slowing down. My heart raced as the sky darkened&mdash;moment by moment, the world dimmed around us.

I’ve waited 7 years for this. And here it was, my promise coming full circle.

**Totality**.

A brilliant halo of light embraced the moon, and everything stopped. Darkness greeted Mazatlán. A hush fell over the crowd. People stood frozen, some cried, some held their breath. But my mind was racing.

*I did it, Mom. I’m here. We made it.*

I stopped looking at the eclipse. I looked at Alexis, Dolores, and Lilia instead.

*This is my family now. They took care of me when you joined the cosmos. They love me like you loved me. I love them like I loved you. I miss you, mom.*

My mom was there that day&mdash;I know it.

I didn’t take a single photo of the eclipse. But I took one video of my family. Capturing the awe, the emotions, the child-like wonder on our faces.

And in my face, the look of a young boy, not just with his family, but with his mom too.
