I’m an over-thinker, a decisive planner&mdash;it’s both a strength and a weakness.

Whether it’s planning a trip into the city, where I map out parking and potential restaurants, or organizing a vacation with friends, I handle every detail. In Puerto Rico, I planned a trip for 10 friends that they still say was one of the best they’ve been on. At work, I rely on project management tools and schedules to stay ahead of deadlines without sacrificing my work-life balance.

But when things change rapidly or unexpectedly, it can throw me off balance.

**On October 17, 2017, I got the call. My mom had died.**

From the moment I got the call, nothing felt real. The Dan from before was suddenly a stranger to me. I couldn’t make decisions. I couldn’t plan. Everyone called and turned to me for guidance, but I had nothing to give. I was paralyzed, frozen in that moment, unable to process what was happening.

I can’t remember who booked my flight or packed my bag. I don’t know how we made it to the airport, who would feed our cat. I don’t know how our family from all over the country managed to land in Florida almost at the same time. I just know they did. And I never really thanked them for that.

While I was frozen in shock, others were in motion, helping me in ways I couldn’t comprehend at the time.

So, thank you. To everyone who got me to Florida. And Alexis, thank you for guiding me when I felt lost.

I only remember making two decisions that day.

One was getting a hotdog from a 7-11 near the airport. I have never once considered buying a hotdog from 7-11 in the past. I also wasn’t hungry. That hotdog sucked, but in the chaos, the randomness felt grounding. It was a decision I could make, something I could control. It also made me laugh.

The other decision was the harder one. My sister and I hadn’t spoken in years, our relationship strained by old, deep wounds. But when I saw her at the airport, I made the choice to forgive. We hugged and cried. My sister needed that to start healing. I did too.

Thea, years later, wrote to me, *Honestly, in a weird way, mom’s passing brought us closer and made me realize how precious life is and how we shouldn’t take anything for granted.*

I agree, Thea.

We packed into a van, driving quietly to Jensen Beach.

I’m grateful my mom passed at home, in the place that held our childhood&mdash;the house where we watched *Rugrats* eating dinner, where love filled every room.

She passed in her sleep, in a home full of cherished memories, with the pets she adored curled up beside her. And while I wasn’t there to hold her hand, I take comfort knowing she was surrounded by everything that made her feel safe.

And on her phone, an unsent text to me: just the letters “lu”. I like to think she was trying to say she loved me one last time.
